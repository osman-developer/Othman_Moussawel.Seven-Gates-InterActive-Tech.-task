Hello it's Othman Moussawel, please find below the source code of the Seven Gates InterActive Technologies's assesment project.
I have set the server port to '8084' but you can change it from : "src/main/resources/application.properties".
I made two packages, one that contains the  AlbumApiApp that starts the app, and a DataController. 
The other package is the one that contanis the models ( the class for users,albums.. ).

-To call the getAllUsers Method : http://localhost:8084/Users  
-To call the getAllAlbumss Method : http://localhost:8084/Albums  
-To call the getAlbumsOfUsers Method : http://localhost:8084/UserAlbum/1  you can put any id for now i put 1 (http://localhost:8084/UserAlbum/id).
I attached a Pictures folder in which I screenshoted the call of the API of https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com  from chrome and pictures from Postman that calls my API.
The image that ends with .(1) is the result of the call of  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com API from the browser whereas the image that ends with .(2) is the result of the call of my API in postman. The reason I did screenshots of the browser and postman in order for you to differentiate between them.
 I used Spring tool suite IDE to develop the application.
Thanks.
